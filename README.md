# breadcrumbs

Breadcrumb function for Wordpress

This is allows visitors to quickly navigate back to a previous section or root page. 
I have also incorporated custom post types and taxonomies. 

This was adopted from <a href="https://github.com/cyberchimps">CyberChimps</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/cyberchimps/responsive">Responsive WordPress Theme</a>

Install:

Copy the function into your functions.php file and then call it within the page template.
